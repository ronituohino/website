# website

My portfolio website.

## Astro

This is a static [astro](https://astro.build/) project. Everything is kept as
simple & fast as possible.

## Solid

For more complicated UI components, we have [solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/)
support.

## Development setup

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and npm works.

```
npm
```

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

Run development server

```
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Deployment is automated with GitHub Actions. Every time something is pushed onto
the main branch, the site is built and deployed to GitHub Pages.

The workflow can also be triggered manually if needed.
