# General design goals

I feel like I want to tell my story with my portfolio, but I don't want to force
the user to see it: "ugh, just take me to your projects, I don't care about the
stuff you did 5 years ago lol"

I want the portfolio to have a cartoonish, hand-drawn, notebook feel with lots
of custom assets.

I also want to maintain responsiveness, so people can view the site well on
mobile also. Accessibility is also a priority.

## Title

Short introduction, some artistic elements. Get user to scroll page down to most
recent projects.

## Projects

Latest first. Dividing hand-drawn elements seperating projects in cool different
ways. Lots of animations and custom elements. Hidden projects (user can
optionally view smaller projects in between)?
