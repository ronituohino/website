# Application requirements

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to serve as a portfolio and blogging website.
Here are some items I want to include in the website:

index page

- [] Hero
  - Name
  - Title
  - Short description
  - Call to action? (Resume?)
- [] Projects
  - Name
  - Short description
  - Image
  - Tech used
  - GitHub link
  - Live link
- [] Contact (Freelancing & Consulting)
  - GitHub
  - LinkedIn
  - Email (mailto)
- [] Link to blog area

blog page

- [] Browser
  - Blog card
  - Blog views
  - Blog likes
- [] Blog page
- [] Link to index page

## UI

The portfolio page is static and displays information about me.

The first section the user is greeted with is the Hero/About section. Here I can
have some cool animations and effects with my name and title. I will either have
two separate things about me, or combine them into one.

The projects section displays a list of my previous projects and some
information about them.

Blog browser displays a grid of blogs with thumbnails and titles. Blogs are
coded into the app itself, so I have full freedom to put any kind of content I
wish on there. Blogs can be liked by anonymous users. There is a views counter
on each blog post.
